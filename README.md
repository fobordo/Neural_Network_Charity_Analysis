# Neural Network Charity Analysis

## Overview

## Results
### Data Preprocessing
#### What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
- The `IS_SUCCESSFUL` variable was considered the target for the model because it indicated whether or not applicants were successful after getting funded by Alphabet Soup.
#### What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
- All of the other variables in the dataset were considered the features of the model because they are factors for the model to consider when determining whether or not applicants were successful after getting funded by Alphabet Soup. These variables included:
    - `APPLICATION_TYPE`
    - `AFFILIATION`
    - `CLASSIFICATION`
    - `USE_CASE`
    - `ORGANIZATION`
    - `STATUS`
    - `INCOME_AMT`
    - `SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS`
    - `ASK_AMT`
#### What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
#### How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
#### Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
#### What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
